# SQLMAP

### Detection And Exploitation Of Database Vulnerabilities

SQL (structured query language) injection is a threat to the applications, which are web-based, mobile application and even desktop application, which are connected to the database. By implementing SQL injection, the attacker can gain full access to the application or database so that it can remove or change significant data irresponsibly. Applications that do not properly validate the user’s input make them vulnerable against SQL injection. SQL Injection Attacks (SQLIA) occurs when an attacker is able to insert a series of malicious SQL statements into a query through manipulating user input data for execution by the back-end database. Using this type of threats, applications could be hacked easily and steal confidential data by the attacker.

### Introduction To SQLMAP

SQLMAP is an open source penetration testing tool on command prompt that automates the process of detecting and exploiting SQL injection flaws and taking over database servers. It comes with a powerful detection engine, many niche features for the ultimate penetration tester and a broad range of switches lasting from database fingerprinting, over data fetching from the database, to access the underlying file system and executing commands on the operating system via out-of-band connections.

### Implementation :
We can get the following information
- Brute Force For Login
- Vulnerable Or Not ?
- Database Name
- User’s Data
- Table Names
- Data From User Table
